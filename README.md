Thank you for taking the time to view my project. I would have deployed it using netlify or github pages, but the mp4 file I have isn't compatitble it seems. 

Below are the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. If you download the entire teslaclone folder, you are able to open it from your code editor.

Right click on the background of the HTML code, and select "Open with Live Server" or "Open in Default Browser."

This website has not been optimized for mobile devices.

Had this website had been made using React, I would be able to deploy it with no problems.
